Be it noted that using this app violates Club Penguin rules and you might be banned. I just hope it won’t result into this because this app doesn’t provide anything other than things you can do in plain old CP (if you have powerful enough PC and lot of patience).</p>
	<p>Also please ask your parent or guardian to change your password temporarily before trying this app. You should never trust anyone with your passwords (<del>not even</del> especially not us). You can change it back then. Don’t blame us if someone is using your account and you gave us your real password.
