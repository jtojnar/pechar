Penguin changing rooms
======================

You know that CP inventory is really slow. This is our attempt on creating inventory that is fast and easy to use.

### About us
We are team behind http://fan-club-penguin.cz – the largest community of Club Penguin players in Czech Republic and Slovakia.

### Installation
1. Download http://cdn.clubpenguin.com/play/en/web_service/game_configs/paper_items.json to current directory
2. Set path to items displayed on penguin. Due to CORS policies we can’t work with canvas, if we use images from other domains. You will have to mirror them (sample mirroring script included in *items/image/*)
